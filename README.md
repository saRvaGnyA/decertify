<hr>

**Theme:** Web3, Open Innovation.

**Problem Statement:** Certificate Verification using Blockchain.

**deCertify** is a <a href="https://celo.org/">Celo</a> based online certificate verification web and app platform which solves the problem of <b>counterfeiting certificates</b> by leveraging the security provided by Blockchain technology to verify and protect your certificates.

### Features
deCertify offers the following features:
- Complete and Seamless integration with [Celo Blockchain](https://celo.org/).
- Students can request to receive verified documents from Organization.
- Organization can certify documents and upload verified document along with seal of verification(embedded qrcode) to IPFS.
- Any institue or individual seeking verification of documents, can do so by accessing the blockchain and verifying the hash with some optional gas charge.

deCertify works as follows:

1. **Student - App Only**
   In the app, a student can request for an e-certificate to the organization. There might be charges associated with this request to get the documents certified by the organization.

2. **Institute/Organization - Web Only**
   After logging in, the organization can view all pending and approved requests, view their documents and have the option to upload them to IPFS after embedding a seal of verification (QRCode) into the PDF.

3. **Verifier - App Only**
   Suppose an employer wants to verify a document submitted by a student. They can just scan the QR Code on the document and check if it matches with the hash of the IPFS document. A report violation will be generated upon false document detection.

## üîÆFuture Scope and Business Potential
- Integrate GraphQL to provide Statistics about the verification requests
- Add Dynamic NFT Support to pass on certificate ownerships from one organization to another (Like School to College). This would ensure seamless, secure and hassle-free custody of documents.
- Provide facility to build a chain of verification on top of organization histories
