<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

## Built With

Celo Composer is built on Celo to make it simple to build dApps using a variety of front-end frameworks.

- [Celo](https://celo.org/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To build your dApp, you'll need to install the dependencies, create a new project, and run the following commands:

## Prerequisites

- Node
- Git (v2.38 or higher)

## How to use Celo Composer

The easiest way to get started with Celo Composer is using `@celo/celo-composer`. This is a CLI tool enables you to quickly start building dApps on Celo for multiple frameworks including React, React Native (w/o Expo), Flutter and Angular. You can create the dApp using default Composer templates provided by Celo. To get started, use the following command:

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer create
```

#### This will prompt you to select the framework and the template you want to use

![Celo Composer select framework](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/celo-composer-create.png?raw=true)

#### Once you select the framework and the template, it will ask you to select the smart contract development environment tool

![Celo Composer tool selection](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/celo-composer-tool.png?raw=true)

#### After selecting the tool, it will ask you whether you want subgraph support for your dApp

![Celo Composer subgraph support](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/celo-composer-subgraph.png?raw=true)

#### Finally, it will ask you for the name of your dApp

![Celo Composer dApp name](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/celo-composer-project-name.png?raw=true)

**_ðŸ”¥Voila, you have your dApp ready to go. You can now start building your dApp on Celo._**
